##  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
* A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

The following advanced readings have been prepared as primers, intended to give you a foundation in some of the topics that may be discussed at the design workshop:

* [A Primer on Functional Identity](functional-identity-primer.md) by Joe Andrieu
* [A Primer on Self-Sovereign identity](self-sovereign-identity-primer.md) by Christopher Allen & Shannon Appelcline
* [DID Primer](did-primer.md) by Drummond Reed & Manu Sporny
