## Abstract

A decentralized key management system (DKMS) aims to solve how consumers can manage their own keys and certificates without relying on a third-party provider having access or controls over the keys..  This method helps to ensure that no third-party can compromise the integrity and security of the system as a whole. Entities can use the system to safely authenticate each other and validate keys and certificates.  Centralized key management systems (CKMS) manage key and certificate creation, signing, and validity.  Specific problems arise when these authorities become unavailable, or the data they control becomes corrupted or known.  Central authorities often become choice targets for attackers.  Our proposal to meet these requirements utilizes a decentralized blockchain ledger for providing an oracle of trust and leaves control over all keys with end users.  The use of a blockchain permits globally readable identifiers and public data to be shared in a secure manner that is not vulnerable to the man-in-the-middle attack or system wide compromise and permits consumers to be self-sovereign.  This leaves consumers with the task of key management and protection.  This proposal covers various ideas for how users can create, recover, backup, and revoke keys and provides recommended suggestions.
