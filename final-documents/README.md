## [*Identity Hubs Capabilities Perspective*](identity-hubs-capabilities-perspective.pdf) [(Text)](identity-hubs-capabilities-perspective.md)

> Identity Hubs as currently proposed in the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) are a subset of a general Decentralized Identifier (DID) based user-controlled agent, based on ACLs rather than an object-capabilities (ocap) architecture. Transitioning the Hubs design to an ocap model can be achieved by introducing an UMA authorization server as the control endpoint.
